# Langtons_Ant

Langton's ant is a two-dimensional Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. The ant moves according to the two rules below:

- At an empty square, turn 90° right, change the color of the square, move forward one unit

- At a colorfull square, turn 90° left, change the color of the square to white, move forward one unit
